### Database
- [ ] Create database schema: `npm run db:setup` or manual SQL
- [ ] Create required indexes ⚠️ (STILL NEEDED):
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
  CREATE INDEX idx_workout_plans_user_id ON workout_plans(user_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_workout_days_plan_id ON workout_days(plan_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_workout_exercises_day_id ON workout_exercises(workout_day_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_user_id ON profiles(user_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_completed_sets_exercise_id ON completed_sets(workout_exercise_id);
  ```
- [ ] Test database connection from production environment
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Test disaster recovery (restore from backup)

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.)
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring (New Relic, DataDog, etc.)
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (CloudWatch, ELK, Datadog, etc.)
- [ ] Configure alerts for:
  - [ ] High error rate (>1%)
  - [ ] High response time (>1s p95)
  - [ ] Database connection failures
  - [ ] Disk space low
  - [ ] Memory usage high

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Integration tests for critical API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests for user flows
- [ ] Load testing (target: 100+ concurrent users)
- [ ] Security testing (OWASP top 10)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Build & Deployment
- [ ] Build project: `npm run build`
- [ ] Verify build succeeds with zero errors
- [ ] Test on staging environment
- [ ] Document all deployment steps
- [ ] Create rollback plan
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Immediate Blockers (Fix Before Any Deployment)

### Critical Security Issues
- [x] Remove hardcoded JWT secrets
- [x] Add authorization checks to protected endpoints
- [x] Fix async/await issues
- [x] Fix SQL injection vulnerability
- [ ] Add rate limiting on auth endpoints ⚠️ STILL NEEDED
- [ ] Add CSRF protection ⚠️ STILL NEEDED

### Data Integrity Issues
- [ ] Implement transaction handling for plan creation ⚠️ STILL NEEDED
- [ ] Validate all input data ✅ (mostly done)
- [ ] Implement pagination to prevent memory exhaustion ⚠️ STILL NEEDED

### Performance Issues
- [ ] Add database indexes ⚠️ STILL NEEDED
- [ ] Implement query caching ⚠️ STILL NEEDED
- [ ] Fix N+1 query problem ⚠️ STILL NEEDED

---

## Staging Deployment (Before Prod)

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run full smoke tests:
   ```bash
   # Test auth flow
   curl -X POST http://staging/api/auth/signup -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123","name":"Test"}'
   curl -X POST http://staging/api/auth/signin -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
   
   # Test plan creation
   curl -X POST http://staging/api/plans -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d '{...}'
   ```
3. Run load test: `ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://staging/api/plans`
4. Monitor logs for errors
5. Check performance metrics
6. Validate data consistency

---

## Production Deployment

### Day Before
- [ ] Final security audit
- [ ] Final performance test
- [ ] Verify all environment variables set
- [ ] Create maintenance window (if needed)
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Notify stakeholders

### Deployment Day
1. Create database backup
2. Deploy code:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   npm ci
   npm run build
   npm run db:migrate
   # Restart server
   ```
3. Smoke tests on production
4. Monitor error rates and performance
5. Check application logs

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all features working
- [ ] Check error tracking for new issues
- [ ] Confirm monitoring/alerts working
- [ ] Communicate status to team
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

---

## Production Monitoring (Ongoing)

### Daily
- [ ] Check error logs (target: zero critical errors)
- [ ] Check performance metrics (p95 response time)
- [ ] Check database query performance
- [ ] Check API usage patterns

### Weekly
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Review dependency updates available
- [ ] Check backup integrity
- [ ] Review performance trends

### Monthly
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Capacity planning (are we approaching limits?)
- [ ] Disaster recovery drill
